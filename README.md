The hotel csv file needs to have Hotel Name,	Email,	Type,	City

Type is for the hotel group, because there is a special paragraph in the main script which changes depending on which hotel group has been mentioned. 
I've also added in the city, so if you're sending out emails to multiple cities, you can just do it with one city as long as the correct city is populated in the csv file.
